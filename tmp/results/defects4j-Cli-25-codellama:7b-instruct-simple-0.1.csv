","(147, 199)","This method is part of the `CommandLine` class in Apache Commons CLI library, and it parses a pattern string to create an instance of `Options`. The `Options` class represents a collection of command-line options that can be used with the `CommandLineParser` class.

The method takes a single argument, which is a string representing the pattern for the options. The pattern string can contain various characters that specify details about each option, such as whether it is required or not, and what type of value it accepts.

Here's a breakdown of how the method works:

1. It initializes some variables to default values: `opt` is set to a space character (` ' '`), `required` is set to false, and `type` is set to null.
2. It iterates over each character in the pattern string using a for loop.
3. For each character, it checks if it is a value code (e.g., `=`, `+`, or `-`) or not. If it is not a value code, it means that we have encountered an option character. In this case, it sets the `opt` variable to the current character and continues to the next iteration.
4. If the current character is a value code (e.g., `=`, `+`, or `-`), it checks if it is a required option (`!`) or not. If it is a required option, it sets the `required` variable to true. Otherwise, it sets the `type` variable to the corresponding value class (e.g., `Integer.class` for `=`, `String.class` for `+`, and `Boolean.class` for `-`).
5. After iterating over all characters in the pattern string, it creates an instance of `Options` using the `Options` constructor that takes a collection of `Option` objects as its argument. It then adds each option to the `Options` object using the `addOption()` method.
6. Finally, it returns the `Options` object.

In summary, this method parses a pattern string and creates an instance of `Options` that represents the command-line options specified in the pattern string. The pattern string can contain various characters that specify details about each option, such as whether it is required or not, and what type of value it accepts."

The method uses a switch statement to check the input character against a set of predefined characters that represent different types of values. If the input character matches one of these predefined characters, the method returns the corresponding object representing the value type. For example, if the input character is '@', the method returns `PatternOptionBuilder.OBJECT_VALUE`, which represents an object value in the pattern.

If the input character does not match any of the predefined characters, the method returns null. This indicates that the input character does not represent a valid value type.

The purpose of this method is to provide a way for users to specify values in a pattern using simple textual representations, such as '@' for an object value or '%' for a number value. By providing these simple representations, users can easily create and manipulate patterns without having to worry about the underlying details of the value types they are working with."

The method first checks if the input string is null or empty, and if so, it simply returns the original string without modifying it. This is done to avoid attempting to trim whitespace from an empty string, which would result in a `NullPointerException`.

If the input string is not empty, the method starts by setting the position of the last character in the string to the length of the string minus 1. This is done using the `length()` method of the `String` class.

Next, the method loops through each character in the string starting from the end and checks if it is a whitespace character using the `Character.isWhitespace()` method. If the character is not a whitespace character, the method breaks out of the loop and returns the resulting substring.

If all characters in the string are whitespace characters, the method returns an empty string. This is done to avoid returning a string that contains only whitespace characters, which would be considered invalid.

Overall, this method removes any trailing whitespace characters from a string and returns the resulting string without modifying the original input string."

2. `width`: an integer value that specifies the maximum width of each line of the wrapped text, in characters.
3. `text`: a string that contains the text to be wrapped and printed.

The method prints the specified text to the output stream, wrapping it at the specified width. The wrapping is done by inserting newline characters (`\n`) into the text at appropriate points so that each line does not exceed the specified width.

For example, if you call `printWrapped(pw, 10, ""This is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped"")`, the method will print the text to the output stream, wrapping it at lines of no more than 10 characters each. The resulting output might look something like this:
```

Note that the wrapping is done based on the number of characters in each line, not on the number of words or other units of text.

The `setNewLine()` method in Java is used to set the default newline character for a `PrintWriter` object. The `PrintWriter` class is used to write text to an output stream, and it uses the newline character to determine where one line ends and the next begins. By default, the newline character is set to the system-dependent line separator string, which can vary depending on the operating system.

The `setNewLine()` method allows you to change this default newline character to a custom string of your choice. For example, if you want to use a different newline character, such as a carriage return (`\r`) or a line feed (`\n`), you can call the `setNewLine()` method and pass in the desired string.

Here is an example of how you might use the `setNewLine()` method:
```
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(""example.txt""));
writer.setNewLine(""\r\n""); // set newline character to carriage return + line feed
writer.println(""Hello, world!""); // write a line of text with the custom newline character
writer.close();
```
In this example, we create a `PrintWriter` object and use it to write a line of text to a file. We set the newline character to be a carriage return (`\r`) followed by a line feed (`\n`), which is the Windows-style newline character. When we call the `println()` method, it will write the text with the custom newline character."

The `renderWrappedText()` method is responsible for actually rendering the text into the buffer, taking into account the wrapping and tab stops. It does this by iterating over the characters in the input string, checking if they are whitespace or not, and inserting line breaks as needed to wrap the text at the specified width.

The `getNewLine()` method returns this value as a `String`, which can then be used to insert a new line in a text file or other text-based data structure. For example, if you want to write a string to a file that contains a newline character, you can use the `getNewLine()` method to get the platform-specific line separator and then append it to the string before writing it to the file.

When this method is called with a non-empty string as its parameter, it sets the value of the `defaultArgName` field to the given string. If the parameter is an empty string, it sets the `defaultArgName` field to an empty string.

This method is used to set the default name for an argument when it is created or modified. It can be useful in situations where the argument has a complex or generic name that is not easily understood by users of the function or method. By setting a default name, the user can provide a more descriptive and meaningful name for the argument, which can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

For example, consider a function called `sort` that takes two arguments: an array of integers and a comparison function. The first argument is the array of integers to be sorted, while the second argument is the comparison function used to determine the order of the elements in the array. If the user does not provide a name for the second argument, it may be difficult to understand what the argument represents or how it should be used.

The method returns an instance of the `CommandLine` class, which contains information about the parsed command line. The `CommandLine` object has several methods and fields that can be used to retrieve information about the parsed command line, such as the options, arguments, and subcommands.

Here is an example of how you might use this method:
```
Options options = new Options();
options.addOption(""h"", ""help"", false, ""print this message"");
options.addOption(""f"", ""file"", true, ""input file"");

String[] arguments = {""-h"", ""-f"", ""input.txt""};
CommandLine commandLine = CommandLine.parse(options, arguments);

if (commandLine.hasOption(""help"")) {
    System.out.println(""Usage: myprogram [options]"");
} else if (commandLine.hasOption(""file"")) {
    String inputFile = commandLine.getOptionValue(""file"");
    // process the input file
}
```
In this example, we define an `Options` object with two options: ""help"" and ""file"". We then pass these options to the `parse()` method along with a string array containing the command line arguments. The `parse()` method returns a `CommandLine` object that contains information about the parsed command line.

We check if the user requested help by calling the `hasOption()` method on the `CommandLine` object and printing the usage message if necessary. If the user did not request help, we retrieve the value of the ""file"" option using the `getOptionValue()` method and process the input file."

The `UnrecognizedOptionException` class is a subclass of the `Exception` class in Java, and it represents an exception that occurs when an unrecognized option is encountered.

The constructor for this class takes a single argument of type `String`, which is used to specify the message associated with the exception. The constructor then calls the parent class's constructor (`super`) to initialize the exception object with the specified message.

In general, this method is used to create an instance of the `UnrecognizedOptionException` class and pass a custom error message to it. This allows the caller to provide more specific information about the nature of the unrecognized option that was encountered.

For example, if a user passes an invalid option to a command-line program, the program can throw an instance of `UnrecognizedOptionException` with a message that describes the invalid option and why it is not recognized. This can help the user understand what went wrong and how they can fix the issue."

The constructor first calls the no-argument constructor of the parent class, which initializes the `cause` and `stackTrace` fields of the exception object. It then sets the `message` field of the exception object to the value passed in as the `message` parameter. Finally, it sets the `option` field of the exception object to the value passed in as the `option` parameter.

The purpose of this constructor is to create an instance of the `UnrecognizedOptionException` class with a specific error message and unrecognized option. The `message` parameter is used to provide more detailed information about the cause of the exception, while the `option` parameter is used to specify the unrecognized option that caused the exception to be thrown.

This exception is typically thrown when an attempt is made to select an item that has already been selected, or when an attempt is made to deselect an item that has not been selected.

The `AlreadySelectedException` class extends the `RuntimeException` class and provides a constructor that takes a message as a parameter. The message is used to provide additional information about the exception, such as the name of the item that was attempted to be selected or deselected.

When an instance of `AlreadySelectedException` is thrown, it indicates that the item in question has already been selected and cannot be selected again. This can occur in situations where multiple items are being managed by a single selection mechanism, and an attempt is made to select an item that has already been selected.

For example, consider a list of items that can be selected or deselected. If an attempt is made to select an item that has already been selected, an instance of `AlreadySelectedException` could be thrown to indicate that the item cannot be selected again. Similarly, if an attempt is made to deselect an item that has not been selected, an instance of `AlreadySelectedException` could be thrown to indicate that the item cannot be deselected.

","(48, 111)","This method is used to flatten an array of command-line arguments into a single array of strings, while taking into account the special options that are recognized by the `Options` class. The method takes three parameters:

* `options`: An instance of the `Options` class, which represents the set of valid options for the command-line program.
* `arguments`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments to be flattened.
* `stopAtNonOption`: A boolean value indicating whether the method should stop processing the arguments when it encounters a non-option argument (i.e., an argument that does not start with ""-""). If this parameter is set to `true`, the method will only process the options and ignore any non-option arguments.

The method works by iterating over the elements of the `arguments` array, and for each element it checks if it is a special option (i.e., starts with ""-"") or not. If it is a special option, the method checks if it is recognized by the `Options` class, and if so, it adds the option to the output array. If it is not a special option, the method checks if it is a non-option argument (i.e., does not start with ""-"") and if `stopAtNonOption` is set to `true`, the method stops processing the arguments and returns the current state of the output array. Otherwise, the method adds the argument to the output array.

The method also takes into account the special option ""--"" which indicates that all remaining arguments should be added to the output array without being processed further.

In summary, this method is used to flatten an array of command-line arguments into a single array of strings, while taking into account the special options recognized by the `Options` class and stopping processing the arguments when it encounters a non-option argument (if specified)."

The method uses the `startsWith` and `endsWith` methods to check if the string starts or ends with a quote, and if so, it removes those quotes using the `substring` method.

The `stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes` method is useful when you need to remove any leading or trailing quotes from a string, regardless of whether they are single or double quotes. This can be useful in situations where you have a string that may contain quotes at the beginning or end, but you don't want to include them in your processing.

For example, if you have a string like `""Hello, world!""`, you can use this method to remove the leading and trailing quotes so that you are left with just `Hello, world!`. This can be useful when you need to process the string further without having to worry about the quotes."

The `hasOptionalArg()` method is a static method in the `OptionBuilder` class of the Apache Commons CLI library. It is used to indicate that an option can have an optional argument.

When this method is called, it sets two properties on the `OptionBuilder` instance:

1. `numberOfArgs`: This property indicates the number of arguments that the option can take. In this case, it is set to 1, which means that the option can take one argument.
2. `optionalArg`: This property indicates whether the argument for the option is optional or not. If this property is set to true, then the argument for the option is optional, and if it is set to false, then the argument is required. In this case, the argument for the option is optional.

By calling `hasOptionalArg()`, you can indicate that an option can have an optional argument, which means that the user can provide a value for the argument or not. If the user does not provide a value for the argument, then the default value will be used instead.

For example, consider the following code:

This will set the `valuesep` field of the `OptionBuilder` class to the colon character (`:`).

Once you have specified the value separator, you can use it in your option parsing code to parse options that contain values. For example, if you have an option named ""--file"" with a value that should be separated by a colon, you can use the following code to parse the option:
```

3. It returns the `instance` object, which allows for method chaining.

For example, if you have an option with a long name ""--file"", you can use the `withArgName` method to set its argument name as ""-f"". Here's how you would do it:
```
OptionBuilder.withLongOpt(""file"")
    .withArgName(""-f"")

If the option does have an argument, then the method sets the `numberOfArgs` field of the `Option` object to 1. Otherwise, it sets it to `Option.UNINITIALIZED`.

This method is used in conjunction with other methods in the `OptionBuilder` class, such as `withArgName`, `withDescription`, and `create`, to create an instance of the `Option` class that represents a command-line option. The `hasArg` method is typically called before calling the `withArgName` or `withDescription` methods, in order to specify whether the option requires an argument or not.

For example:
```
OptionBuilder builder = new OptionBuilder();
builder.hasArg(true); // Specify that the option has an argument
builder.withArgName(""FILE""); // Specify the name of the argument
builder.withDescription(""Reads a file"");
Option option = builder.create();
```
In this example, the `hasArg` method is called with a value of `true`, which indicates that the option requires an argument. The `withArgName` method is then used to specify the name of the argument, and the `withDescription` method is used to provide a description of the option.

The `clone()` method is a method in the `Object` class that creates a shallow copy of an object. It returns a new instance of the same class as the original object, with all of its fields and values copied over to the new instance. The `clone()` method is used to create a duplicate of an object, which can be useful for creating copies of objects that are immutable or for creating multiple instances of an object without affecting each other.

In the case of the `Option` class, the `clone()` method creates a shallow copy of the `Option` instance by calling the `super.clone()` method and then copying over the values in the `values` field to the new instance. The `values` field is an `ArrayList` that contains the values for the option.

The `catch` block catches any `CloneNotSupportedException` that may be thrown by the `super.clone()` method and wraps it in a `RuntimeException`. This is done to ensure that the method always returns an instance of the same class as the original object, even if there are any issues with cloning the object.

Overall, the `clone()` method provides a convenient way to create a copy of an object without having to manually copy over each field and value. It is a useful method for creating copies of objects that are immutable or for creating multiple instances of an object without affecting each other."

The `getArgs()` method in Java is a built-in method that returns an integer value representing the total number of command-line arguments passed to the program. This method is typically used in conjunction with the `main` method, which is the entry point for a Java application.

Here's how the `getArgs()` method works:

1. The `main` method is called when the program starts, and it passes an array of command-line arguments to the `getArgs()` method.
2. The `getArgs()` method returns the length of this array, which represents the total number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
3. The returned value can be used by the program to determine how many command-line arguments were passed and what they are.

```
public class MyProgram {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(""Number of arguments: "" + getArgs());
  }
}
```
When you run this program with the following command-line arguments:

The `hashCode()` method in Java is a built-in method that is used to calculate the hash code of an object. The hash code is a unique integer value that represents the object's identity and can be used for fast lookups in collections such as maps or sets.

In the context of the `Option` class, the `hashCode()` method calculates the hash code of the `opt` and `longOpt` fields. The method first checks if either field is not null, and if it is, it calculates its hash code using the `hashCode()` method of the respective field. If both fields are null, the method returns 0 as the hash code.

The `hashCode()` method is used to ensure that two objects with the same values in their fields have the same hash code. This is important because it allows for fast lookups in collections where the hash code of an object is used to determine its position in the collection. If two objects with the same values in their fields have different hash codes, they will be stored in different positions in the collection, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

In general, the `hashCode()` method is used to provide a unique identifier for an object that can be used for fast lookups and comparisons. It is typically implemented by returning a value that is based on the values of the object's fields, and it is used in conjunction with the `equals()` method to ensure that two objects are considered equal if they have the same hash code and values in their fields."

The `hasOptionalArg()` method in Java is a getter method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the current object represents an optional argument.

When a method or constructor has an optional argument, it means that the caller can choose whether or not to pass a value for that argument.

The `hasOptionalArg()` method is used to check if the current object represents an optional argument. If the method returns `true`, it means that the current object is an optional argument, and if it returns `false`, it means that the current object is not an optional argument.

This method is useful in situations where you need to determine whether a parameter is required or optional. For example, if you have a method that takes two parameters, one of which is optional, you can use this method to check if the second parameter is an optional argument before proceeding with any further processing."

The `getValueSeparator()` method in Java is a part of the `Properties` class, which represents a set of key-value pairs. This method returns the value separator used by this `Properties` object to separate values from keys in the property list.

In other words, it returns the character that is used to separate the value of a property from its key. For example, if you have a property with the key ""color"" and the value ""red"", the value separator would be the character that separates the two, such as an equals sign (=) or a colon (:).

The `getValueSeparator()` method is useful when you need to access the value of a specific property in a `Properties` object. For example, if you want to get the value of the ""color"" property, you can use the following code:
```
String color = properties.getProperty(""color"");
```
The `getValueSeparator()` method is not commonly used directly by developers, but it is useful when you need to access the value separator used by a `Properties` object."

1. It calls the `getKey()` method to get the value stored in the `key` field.
2. It uses the `charAt(0)` method to extract the first character of the string returned by `getKey()`.

The method name `setOptionalArg` suggests that it is used to set an optional argument for the current object. The parameter `optionalArg` is of type `boolean`, which means that it can only have two values: `true` or `false`.

When this method is called with a value of `true`, it indicates that the optional argument should be set to `true`. When it is called with a value of `false`, it indicates that the optional argument should be set to `false`.

The method sets the value of the `optionalArg` field in the current object to the value passed as an argument. This means that if the method is called with a value of `true`, the `optionalArg` field will be set to `true`, and if it is called with a value of `false`, the `optionalArg` field will be set to `false`.

The purpose of this method is to provide a way for subclasses to add values to the collection without having to worry about any additional processing or validation that may be required. The addValueForProcessing method can perform any necessary processing or validation before adding the value to the collection, which makes it more convenient and easier to use than the addValue method.

If the option has an argument (i.e., it ends with a colon), the method checks if there are more characters in the token after the hyphen. If there are, it adds the remaining characters as a separate token to the list of tokens.

If the character is not an option character or if the `stopAtNonOption` parameter is set to true and the character is not an option character, the method adds the entire token as a single token to the list of tokens.

* `arguments`: an array of strings representing the command line arguments.

2. It processes each command line token in turn, starting with the first one.
3. For each token, it checks whether it is a long option (e.g., `--foo`) or a short option (e.g., `-f`). If it is a long option, it checks whether the corresponding option has been defined in the `Options` instance. If not, it processes the token as a non-option argument. Otherwise, it adds the option to the list of tokens and continues processing the next token.
4. If the token is a short option that requires bursting (e.g., `-abc`), the method calls the `burstToken()` method to process each character in the token separately.
5. For all other tokens, it adds them to the list of tokens and continues processing the next token.
6. Once all command line tokens have been processed, the method returns an array of strings representing the flattened list of tokens.

The `flatten()` method is useful for parsing command line arguments in a way that allows for options to be specified multiple times (e.g., `-v -v` or `--verbose --verbose`). It also allows for options to be combined with other options, such as `-abc` and `-a -b -c`."

The `iterator()` method in Java is a way to iterate over a collection of objects. It returns an iterator object that can be used to traverse the elements of the collection.

Here's how it works:

1. The `iterator()` method is called on the collection object, which returns an iterator object.
2. The iterator object has methods such as `hasNext()`, `next()`, and `remove()` that can be used to iterate over the elements of the collection.
3. The `hasNext()` method checks if there are any more elements in the collection that have not been visited yet. If there are, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
4. The `next()` method returns the next element in the collection that has not been visited yet. It also marks the element as visited, so that it won't be returned again by subsequent calls to `next()`.
5. The `remove()` method removes the last element returned by `next()` from the collection.

The `iterator()` method is useful when you need to iterate over a collection of objects in a specific order. It allows you to traverse the elements of the collection one at a time, and it also provides a way to remove elements from the collection while iterating over it.

Here's an example of how you might use the `iterator()` method:
```
List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add(""apple"");
myList.add(""banana"");
myList.add(""cherry"");

Iterator<String> iterator = myList.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    String fruit = iterator.next();
    System.out.println(fruit);
}
```
In this example, we create a list of strings and add three elements to it. We then call the `iterator()` method on the list to get an iterator object that we can use to traverse the elements of the list. We loop over the elements using the `hasNext()` and `next()` methods, and print each element to the console."

For example, if you have a command line with options `-a` and `-b`, and you call this method with the argument `""-a""`, it will return an array containing all the values associated with the `-a` option. If there are no values associated with the `-a` option, the method will return `null`."

2. Next, the method calls `resolveOption(opt)` to resolve the given option and get its type. The `resolveOption()` method returns an `Option` object that represents the given option. If the option cannot be resolved, `null` is returned.
3. Once the option is resolved, the method checks if the value of the option is null. If it is, `null` is returned.

The method takes four parameters:

* `arguments`: an array of strings representing the command-line arguments to be parsed. If this parameter is null or empty, the method will use an empty list instead.

If this parameter is true, any arguments after the first non-option argument will be treated as additional arguments and not parsed as options.

The method works by iterating over the flattened list of tokens obtained from the `getOptions()` method, which returns a list of all the available options for the command-line tool. For each token in the list, it checks if it is an option, an argument, or a double-dash (indicating that all remaining arguments should be treated as additional arguments).

2. `String[] arguments`: an array of strings representing the command line arguments to be parsed.

The method returns a new instance of the `CommandLine` class, which contains information about the parsed command line arguments. The `parse()` method is overloaded and has several variations with different parameters. This specific variation takes two additional parameters:

1. `boolean stopAtNonOption`: a boolean flag that indicates whether to stop parsing at the first non-option argument (i.e., an argument that does not start with `-` or `--`). If set to `true`, the method will return as soon as it encounters a non-option argument, and any remaining arguments will be ignored.
2. `boolean ignoreLeadingHyphen`: a boolean flag that indicates whether to ignore leading hyphens in option names (i.e., whether to treat `-` or `--` as equivalent). If set to `true`, the method will not consider the first character of an option name when parsing, and any options that start with `-` or `--` will be treated as non-options.

The `parse()` method parses the command line arguments and returns a new instance of the `CommandLine` class containing information about the parsed arguments. The `CommandLine` class provides methods for accessing the parsed options and their values, as well as methods for checking whether certain options were specified on the command line."

The `getOptions()` method in the provided code is a getter method for an instance variable called `options`. It returns the value of the `options` variable, which is likely to be an object that represents the options or settings for some kind of operation or process.

In general, a getter method is used to retrieve the value of a private field or property in an object. The method is typically named after the name of the field it retrieves, with the addition of the word ""get"" at the beginning. For example, if you have a private field called `name`, you might have a corresponding getter method called `getName()`.

In this case, the `options` variable is likely to be an object that represents the options or settings for some kind of operation or process. The method returns the value of this object, which can then be used by other parts of the code to access and manipulate the options.

It's worth noting that the `getOptions()` method is protected, which means it can only be accessed within the class where it is defined. This is a way to enforce encapsulation and ensure that the internal workings of the class are not exposed to other parts of the code."

* `stopAtNonOption`: a boolean value indicating whether the method should stop parsing at the first non-option argument.

The method returns an array of strings, which is the result of flattening the `arguments` array. The exact behavior of this method depends on the specific implementation of the `CommandLineParser` interface that is being used. However, in general, it is expected to parse the `arguments` array and return a new array with any options or non-option arguments removed.

For example, if the `arguments` array contains the following elements:
```
[""--foo"", ""bar"", ""baz""]
```
And the method is called with `stopAtNonOption` set to `true`, it may return an array like this:
```
[""bar"", ""baz""]

Next, the method checks if the option is present in the short options map (represented by the `shortOpts` field) using the `containsKey()` method. If it is, the method returns the corresponding value from the map using the `get()` method.

If the option is not found in the short options map, the method checks if it is present in the long options map (represented by the `longOpts` field) using the same `containsKey()` method. If it is, the method returns the corresponding value from the map using the same `get()` method.

The method starts by creating a new `StringBuffer` object, which is used to build the string representation of the object.
